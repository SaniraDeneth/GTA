# API contracts

All JSON responses use `{ "success": true, "data": {} }`. Errors use `{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "Human-readable error" } }`. Session-authenticated requests send the HTTP-only session cookie. IDs are MongoDB IDs and dates are ISO-8601 strings.

The listed request fields map to the five Mongoose models. Exact validation and error codes should be added by the responsible developer without changing the response envelope. Until implemented, route placeholders return `501 NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

Validation errors may add `error.fields`, which maps a form field to its message. Registration uses `email`, `password`, `teamName`, `leaderName` and `members`.

On registration, the server sets `leaderEmail` from `email` and always counts the leader as a member, so `team.members` only needs the other members. Team size is limited by `TEAM_MIN_SIZE` and `TEAM_MAX_SIZE`.

All `/api/team/*` routes need a team session and all `/api/admin/*` routes need an admin session: 401 when signed out, 403 for the wrong account type.
